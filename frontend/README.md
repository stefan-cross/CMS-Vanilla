A few steps for creating a project from Scratch:


Install dependencies manually with:
   
    > bower install bootstrap --save
    > bower install angular-bootstrap

...or create package.json and then run:

    > npm install


Create gulpfile.js and add the various

    > gulp inject
    > gulp watch


I realise that the http work is a bit manual and should use ng-resource but this a learning exercise.
